/* 9.10.The problem is that when multiple state updates are made during a single event handler, React batches those updates and applies them asynchronously. Since the updates depend on the **current value** of the state at the time they are scheduled, both `setState(count + 1)` calls use the same initial value of `count` (e.g., `0`). As a result, React only applies the last update (`count + 1`), and you don't get the cumulative effect of `+1 + 1` as expected. 

Yes, exactly! The solution is to use a callback function (or functional update) in setState to access the most recent previous state. This ensures that each state update is based on the latest value of the state.*/

/*  11.The inner count logs 0 because the first setCount(25) hasn't applied yet (state updates are batched asynchronously).
After both setCount(25) calls, React applies the state change (count = 25) and re-renders the component.
The inner count logs 25 after the re-render, and no further updates happen because the state is already 25.
This is why you see inner count = 0 followed by inner count = 25 â€” React batches the updates and only performs one re-render with the final state value (25). */
